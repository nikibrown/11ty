<h1>Butternut Squash, Sausage, and Kale Gnocchi SkilletButternut Squash, Sausage, and Kale Gnocchi Skillet with a wooden
    spoon in the skillet.</h1>
<span>YIELD: 4-5 SERVINGS</span>


<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>2 packages Trader Joes Chicken Meatballs</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
    <li>1/2 cup diced yellow onion</li>
    <li>3 cups peeled and cubed butternut squash (1/2 inch cubes)</li>
    <li>1 clove garlic, grated or minced</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon chopped fresh rosemary</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes (optional)</li>
    <li>16 ounces gnocchi</li>
    <li>4 cups chopped kale</li>
    <li>1 1/4 cups low sodium chicken broth</li>
    <li>1/2 cup shredded part skim mozzarella cheese</li>
</ul>

<h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Over medium-high heat, spray a skillet with cooking oil or drizzle in about a teaspoon. Squeeze the sausage out
        of the casing and into the skillet. Use a potato masher or wooden spoon to crumble the sausage. Once the sausage
        is cooked through remove it from the skillet and onto a plate lined with paper towels to soak up any excess
        grease.</li>

    <li>Add a tablespoon olive oil to the skillet along with the diced onion and cubed butternut squash. Season with
        salt and pepper. Cook the vegetables over medium heat stirring frequently.</li>
    <li>When the squash is tender, approximately 8-10 minutes, add garlic, rosemary, nutmeg, and red pepper flakes. Cook
        another minute and then pour in the chicken broth. Scrape up any of the brown bits from the bottom of the
        skillet then stir in the gnocchi and kale.</li>
    <li>Cover the skillet with a lid and simmer over medium-low heat until the gnocchi is tender, about 5 minutes.
        Remove the lid and stir in the sausage. Taste for seasoning. Sprinkle the mozzarella over the top of everything
        and cover with the lid again. Cook for a couple more minutes or until the cheese is melted. Serve immediately.
